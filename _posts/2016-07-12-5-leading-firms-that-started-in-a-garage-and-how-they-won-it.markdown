Google wasn’t born in its gigantic complex, Amazon didn’t always occupy its huge glass building and Apple’s enormous infinity-inspired campus wasn’t always its home. Even the biggest companies in the world had to start somewhere.  

<h3>1.Amazon</h3>

In 1994, Jeff Bezos quit his job and rented an $890/month house because he wanted to boast of starting his company in a garage, as HP and Apple. There was a time when operating from a garage, Amazon made $27,000 in two weeks, with <b><a href="http://www.amzinsight.com/">amazon selling</a></b> only books. Last year, it made an average of $2.1 billion in a week.

Until recently, Amazon hardly ever registered a profit because Bezos believed in reinvesting every dollar into long-term projects. Amazon’s most revolutionary projects, the Kindle notably, are the result of years of research and development. Bezos has always been unfalteringly resolute to make Amazon a long-term corporation. 

In his now famous 1997 shareholder letter, Bezos stressed how much long-term planning meant to him. “We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be…over the long term.”

<h3>2.Apple</h3>

In 1975, Steve Jobs and Wozniak began working on Apple I in Jobs’ parents’ garage. From 1977-1986, Apple was sinking, with Jobs being ousted as CEO. In 1997, he was rehired and by the time of his death, Apple was the most valuable company in the world.  

The Apple Jobs created valued creativity above all else. Jobs was notoriously rude to people who didn’t challenge ideas. He lived for the thrill the process of creation gave him and he turned Apple into a brand synonymous with ground-breaking innovation. Apple doesn’t always listen to customers but believes in creating pioneering products that will automatically attract them. It’s why fans are ready to wait hours in lines for the newest iPhone. 

<h3>3.Google</h3>

Started in 1998, Google began operations in a rented-out garage owned by Susan Wojcicki (CEO YouTube). Larry Page and Sergey Brin were looking for a place where they could design an algorithm for their search engine project. In 1999, the duo tried selling Google for $1 million. Last year, it raked in $74.54 billion. 

Google’s philosophy has always been connectivity and accessibility– bringing together the world’s information for all to access. Luckily for them, the company was founded at a time when globalization was a growing concept. Google, therefore, worked because it connected globally. What they offered was what everyone, everywhere needed – information. They’ve established themselves as essentially a data service that can be used by anyone who can read and has an internet connection.  

<h3>4.Microsoft</h3>

Way back in 1975, Bill Gates and Paul Allen teamed up to begin what would become the company that kicked off the PC era. Seeing an ad for a PC named Altair 8800, they offered the owners a BASIC interpreter for it – something they hadn’t actually developed. Next year, Microsoft reported a profit of $22,496. Last year, they brought in $93.58 billion. 

Bill Gates is a visionary, but he’s also a self-proclaimed architect. At Microsoft, Gates put the most focus on envisioning a model with features that can operate everything and to build intricately connected software– like Windows. Microsoft comes up with a goal that seems monstrous and then, heads out to achieve it by tortuously building each step towards the goal. Overtime, the firm has inspired countless other people and startups, like Mark Zuckerberg and AMZ Insight.

<h3>5.Hewlett-Packard (HP)</h3>

It wouldn’t be wrong to suggest that HP gave birth to Silicon Valley. Bill Hewlett and David Packard were among the first individuals to set up an IT startup in Palo Alto in 1939. Hewlett-Packard, called simply HP, first successfully sold an audio oscillator for $55. Their revenue last year was $111 billion. 

Packard has consistently laid stress on his philosophy to manage by objective (as opposed to control), which was a radical idea at the time. Back then, it was believed that employees worked for money. Packard revolutionized management by allowing employees the freedom they needed to create. He understood that his employees were working because they wanted to be a part of something greater than their individual selves – and definitely greater than money.
