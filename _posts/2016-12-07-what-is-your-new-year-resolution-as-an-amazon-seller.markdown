2016 has almost ended and it has been a great year for Amazon sellers. With 2017 knocking our doors, the best method to enhance your experience as a seller on Amazon is to look back at your journey last year. What selling strategy was the most productive for you? Which products helped you achieve a higher ROI? While most New Year’s resolutions revolve around losing weight or leaving or starting a particular habit, an Amazon seller must make a New Year resolution which would actually be helpful in expanding his Amazon business. Following is the list of objectives, if achieved, would surely be helpful in maximizing revenue next year:-

<h3>1) Add new products to your ‘attaché case’</h3>

Maintaining a diverse product portfolio is one of the best selling strategies on Amazon. Look for niche opportunities, that distinguishes you from your competitors and help achieve higher sales ranks. If your concentration is focused on a particular product category, for example, kitchen or fitness etc., analyze the best sellers and their price strategies and try including similar products in your arsenal and look forward to develop a marque. 

<h3>2) Improve and Proliferate Product Reviews</h3>

 <b><a href="http://www.amzinsight.com/">Amazon research</a></b>  suggests that many purchasers base their decision about purchasing a product on the ratings and product reviews received by that product. Product reviews are a great source for marketing your product. Research the most searched keywords on Amazon and use these keywords to best describe your product and achieve high sales ranks. Try interacting with the authors of negative reviews, hear their concerns and try turning them into 5 star ratings. While it might seem like an uphill, employee a review tracking tool to take care of the negative reviews for you.

<h3>3) Inflate your profit margins</h3>

Try selling products which cost less and have a healthy profit margin. Find suppliers supplying goods of the similar quality at a reduced cost, to maximize your revenue. If shipping costs eat up a sizeable part of your margin, try formulating a strategy which would not only help in a reducing shipping costs, but will also be helpful in enhancing profit margins. Try selling products in bundles. This would result in a multiplied value of the goods for the customers without increasing the cost of shipping the goods. Simple yet effective. A resolution must be made by almost every Amazon seller this New Year, to cut down almost all needless costs.

<h3>4) Overcome your weaknesses</h3>

Take a bird’s eye view of your last year’s performance and make a self-assessment to identify all the potential weaknesses which caused you to be listed as the second best seller and why not the best. Identify the reasons behind your defeat in the virtual dual of sales and the strengths which made your competitor stand out victorious. Try breaking your problems into smaller fragments which would make it easier for you to find remedies for such disorders. Formulate price strategies which are more responsive to the ever-changing  <b><a href="http://www.amzinsight.com/features/">price trends of the Amazon marketplace</a></b>.

<h3>5) Work Smart not Hard</h3>

Profitability and sales have a direct relationship. An increase in sales results in an increase in profitability. Achieve the best seller ranks and consequently better visibility, using keyword optimization. Higher visibility means a greater reach to audiences, which in turn means higher opportunities to gain more sales. You can also ask social media to lend a helping hand in marketing your product, to reach out to a newer, larger audience. Run a niche analysis to determine the amount of revenue that can be generated in a specific segment of the market. Hence, work smart not hard.
